# Bootcamp Portfolio

These are some of the programs I built during a coding bootcamp, which covered web development and Python programming.

## Web Development
*During the web development component of the course I learnt HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery, and learnt how to implement responsive design, UX/UI and accessibility concepts into my work.*

* [**Rock, Paper, Scissors**](https://github.com/hpellis/rock_paper_scissors)  

    This is a simple JavaScript/JQuery-based browser game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  
    
    It is hosted on GitHub Page [here](https://hpellis.github.io/rock_paper_scissors/).

* [**Data Plans**](https://github.com/hpellis/dataplans)  

    I built this website in response to a brief to show the various prices for different data plan options to customers. I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create the front end, and coded the calulator functions in JavaScript and JQuery.  
    
    It is hosted on GitHub Page [here](https://hpellis.github.io/dataplans/).

## Learning Python
*The course covered core Python concepts, including data structures, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, exception handling, control flow, variable scope, algorithms, abstraction, scripting, object-oriented programme, modules and debugging.*

* [**Guessing Game**](https://github.com/hpellis/guessing_game)

    I made this terminal game using the randint function from the random library to select a number between 1 and 100. Users have seven attempts to guess the correct number, and while they have remaining attempts they can enter new guesses. For each guess the user is told if it is too high or too low.

* [**Dice Game**](https://github.com/hpellis/dice_game)

    This is a simple terminal game that uses the randint function to simulate dice rolls, and asks a user to guess whether the result will be even or odd.

* [**Bouncing Shapes**](https://github.com/hpellis/bouncing_shapes)

    I completed this project, which uses Python's turtle module to 'draw' within a frame, while learning object-oriented programming.

## Projects

* [**Asteroid Watch**](https://github.com/hpellis/asteroid_watch)  

    This is the first web app that I made. It is written in Python and uses the Flask framework to pass data between HTML pages and the Python engine. It calls a NASA API to check how many asteroids are currently in the near earth orbit, and returns information about these.  
    
    It is deployed on Heroku and can be viewed [here](https://sheltered-savannah-14979.herokuapp.com/).

* [**Phonebook Webapp**](https://github.com/hpellis/phonebook_webapp)  

    This full-stack web application is an online phonebook which can be used to search for (invented) businesses or individuals who appear in the database. I used SQLite to create a database, and built a Python search engine that uses SQL queries to find and return relevant results. The app is accessible via a front-end interface, which uses Flask to receive user inputs from HTML forms and to send search results to HTML tables.   

* [**Task Manager Webapp**](https://github.com/hpellis/task_manager_app)  

    For my final project I made a CRUD task manager app. I built a RESTful API with Python and Flask, and used Jinja to connect this to an HTML/CSS front-end. I also used SQLite to create a database and wrote SQL queries to populate the database and retrieve and edit entries from it.
